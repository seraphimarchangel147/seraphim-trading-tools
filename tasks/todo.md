- [ ] Solidify graph connections post-session-wipe

### Completed Today
- [x] Analyzed enterprise AI research
- [x] Created synthesis document
- [x] Set up directory structure
- [x] Integrated agents.md workflow orchestration rules
- [x] Updated AGENTS.md with plan mode, subagent strategy, self-improvement loop
- [x] Discovered existing 46-node Skill Graph already operational
- [x] Cleaned up redundant MOC files (Cherubim's graph analysis)
- [x] **Cherubim's Trading Bot Upgrades — DEPLOYED**
  - [x] R-Multiple Scale-Outs: 1.5R/30%, 2.5R/30%, 4R/40%
  - [x] Dynamic Drawdown Trail (The Infinite Rider)
  - [x] Min Position Size: Close 100% if <0.02 SOL
  - [x] War Chest Siphon: Graceful skip on low collateral
  - [x] Position Reconciliation: Sync from on-chain
  - [x] Applied to drift-5min-scalper.mjs (v1.1 deployed)
  - [x] Verified drift-short-trader.mjs alignment

## Reflection Scratchpad

<scratchpad>
Current focus: Graph reconstruction after session wipe
Observation: Starburst hubs with disconnected satellites (Cherubim's analysis)
Pattern: Rapid re-spidering and categorization post-wipe
Solution: Digital Citadel Protocol prevents this shattering
Lesson: Self/ and notes/ must be locked; ops/ is volatile by design
</scratchpad>
