## Part B: Third-Party Skills Audit

From **skills.sh** and other sources:

| Skill | Source | Risk Level | Verdict |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| nix-develop | skills.sh | Medium | ⚠️ Review — alters environments |
| docker | skills.sh | Medium | ⚠️ Review — privileged ops |
| claude-research | skills.sh | Medium | ⚠️ Review — data handling |
| homebrew | skills.sh | Low | ✅ Safe (macOS only) |
| ssh | skills.sh | High | 🚫 SKIP — network risk |
| aws | skills.sh | High | 🚫 SKIP — credentials risk |

**Decision**: ✅ **All critical functionality recreated locally**

No third-party dependencies needed. All skills are:
- 100% local
- 100% auditable
- 0 network calls
- User-approved actions only
