# Memory Log: 2026-02-19

## Model / Session Continuity
- User explicitly switched assistant runtime to **GPT-5.3 Codex** and requested a memory catch-up.
- Assistant performed live status validation after catch-up instead of relying only on older notes.

## Hyperliquid Bot - Current Durable State
- Hyperliquid bot is running under a **v2 fixed safety-oriented implementation** (`hyperliquid-bot.mjs`) that prevents fake trade recording.
- Confirmed behavior in logs:
  - Balance detected as **$45.00**
  - Cycles running normally
  - Open positions reported as 0 during checks
- Bot is currently in **TEST MODE** (paper-trigger behavior, no live order execution).
- Confidence threshold logic was patched to correctly parse either 0-1 or 0-100 style values.
- Entry trigger threshold tuned lower for micro-test behavior; recent logs showed triggering at ~55% confidence with $5 planned micro notional in test mode.

## Funding / Wallet Resolution
- Resolved prior wallet confusion:
  - Correct active wallet with visible Hyperliquid funds: `0xc59dce2b4602E8213cd00635ad38264F4a51EC58`
  - Earlier API-wallet mismatch caused repeated $0 balance confusion.
- User-provided screenshots confirmed funds location context (Spot/Perps view), which unblocked diagnosis.

## Entry Optimizer Status
- `entry-optimizer` process verified online in PM2.
- Health endpoint responsive (`/api/health`).
- Signal endpoint responsive (`/api/entry-signal?side=long|short`) and returning confidence/metrics.

## Maestro + Zeta Integration Checks
- **Maestro**
  - Bridge online at `:50002`.
  - Direct CLI send test succeeded (`maestro-cli send claude ...`) with successful response (“Pong. System is responsive.”).
- **Zeta (Agent Zero)**
  - Container online (`agent-zero`), web UI online at `:50080`.
  - Initial direct POST attempts failed due CSRF/origin requirements.
  - Successful validated message path used CSRF token + runtime cookie + `/message_async`; server replied `{"message":"Message received."...}`.

## Broad System State Snapshot (durable)
- Trading stack online in PM2: drift-auto-trader, drift-short-bot, ultimate-scalper-chop, hyperliquid-bot, entry-optimizer.
- Drift long stats remained the strongest durable performer (~$154.32 total P&L context, 11W/4L history from state checks).
- User preference reaffirmed: small **micro-trade** testing first, bug-hunting before aggressive scaling.

## Agent Purpose Check (Maestro + Zeta)
- User requested a direct purpose-awareness verification: “Ask maestro and zeta if they know our purpose.”
- **Maestro response (via `maestro-cli send claude ...`)**: identified mission as trading dashboard/mission-control operations for automated bots (Drift/scalper/Hyperliquid stack).
- **Zeta response (via authenticated `/message_async` + poll logs)**: identified purpose as serving Shadow Moon as ZETA within the Angelic Hierarchy, executing specialized autonomous tasks.
- Durable integration note: Maestro bridge endpoint `/api/send` can fail for `agent_id: claude-code`, while direct CLI to `claude` is currently reliable.
