## Issues Identified

### 🔴 Issue 1: Low SOL Balance
- **Status:** ⚠️ Warning appearing in logs
- **Message:** `⚠️ Low SOL balance! Need at least 0.15 SOL`
- **Impact:** May prevent trade execution even when signals align
- **Action Required:** Fund wallet with ~0.1 SOL

### 🟡 Issue 2: Missing `side` Property in HOLD Signal
- **Location:** `btc-leading-indicator.mjs`
- **Symptom:** Log shows `BTC Signal: undefined (grade: HOLD, confidence: 0.00)`
- **Root Cause:** HOLD signals don't include `side: 'NONE'` property
- **Impact:** Cosmetic only - bot correctly skips trades

### 🟡 Issue 3: No Trade Execution
- **Cause:** BTC is in HOLD regime (not BEAR/VOLATILE/CHOP)
- **Bot Logic:** Only trades in allowed regimes: `['BEAR', 'VOLATILE', 'CHOP']`
- **Required Grades:** Only `A+` or `A` setups
- **Current Status:** Waiting for market conditions

---

## Improvements Suggested

### 1. **Fund the Wallet** (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# Send ~0.1 SOL to:
BH2NhBPDKsA2RGiT2W1GfxXMYgqhXpKQpPi6ipsTyaDo
```

### 2. **Fix Code Bug** (Priority: LOW - Cosmetic)
Add `side: 'NONE'` to HOLD signal return in `btc-leading-indicator.mjs` ~line 275

### 3. **Consider Regime Adjustment** (Priority: MEDIUM)
The bot is strictly SHORT-only and requires bearish/volatile conditions. Given current market:
- Consider if SHORT-only is optimal for current BTC trend
- Could add LONG capability for bull markets
- Or reduce grade requirements if too strict

### 4. **Add Trade History Tracking**
Create a `trades.json` file to persist trade history across restarts

## Comparison with Working Bots

| Bot | Status | Uptime | Trades | Notes |
|-----|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| drift-short-bot | 🟢 Online | 23h | Active | Healthy, executing trades |
| 5min-scalper | 🟢 Online | 21h | **0** | Waiting for SHORT signals |
| regime-switcher | 🟢 Online | 3h | N/A | Active monitoring |

---

## Market Context

The bot is correctly identifying that BTC is not in a favorable regime for SHORT scalping. This is **expected behavior** — the bot is being selective and waiting for high-probability setups rather than forcing trades in unfavorable conditions.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor for first trade** — The first trade will indicate the bot has found a valid SHORT signal
2. **Fund wallet** — Ensure SOL balance is sufficient when trades trigger
3. **Consider patience** — No trades in 264 cycles suggests disciplined signal filtering, not a bug
4. **Optional:** Evaluate if current market conditions warrant a SHORT-only strategy
