## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

**KPIs to Track:**
| Metric | Q1 Target | Q2 Target | Q4 Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Non-trading revenue | $500 | $2,000 | $10,000 |

## 🔐 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

**Operational Security:**
- Use hardware wallets for all revenue-generating accounts
- Separate wallets per opportunity type (isolation)
- Never store keys in plain text (use env vars)
- Regular key rotation for automated systems

**Smart Contract Risk:**
- Only use audited protocols (Aave, Compound, Marinade)
- Limit exposure per protocol (< 20% of capital)
- Monitor protocol health via alerts

**Automation Risk:**
- All automated scripts need kill switches
- Daily reconciliation of all positions
- Maximum transaction limits
- Multi-sig for large withdrawals
