# Testimonial Design Principles

Design principles for social proof that persuades without feeling manipulative or templated.

---

## 1. Social Proof Psychology

### Why Testimonials Work (When Done Right)

**Specificity beats generality**
- "Fixed our leak in 2 hours" is more credible than "Great service!"
- Details = believability: times, locations, problems, results

**Named, identifiable people are more credible**
- "Sarah Mitchell, Homeowner in Maitland" > "John D."
- People trust reviews from people they can verify exist

**Relevant context matters**
- The reviewer's situation should match the visitor's situation
- Match the review's context to the page's context

**Quality over quantity**
- One detailed story beats ten "5 stars great service" reviews
- If you only have weak testimonials, you're better off not showing any

## 2. Lead-Gen vs Client Sites: Critical Distinction

### Client Sites (You Have Real Customers)

**Pull from actual reviews:**
- Google Business Profile reviews
- Facebook reviews
- Industry-specific platforms (TrueLocal, etc.)
- Link back to the source platform for verification

**Use real names and real photos:**
- Full names when possible (or first name + last initial)
- No stock photography — ever

**Show verification:**
- "Read more on Google" link
- Platform badges (Google, Facebook)
- Star rating that matches the platform
- Review date

### Lead-Gen Sites (No Real Customers Yet)

**DO NOT fabricate testimonials.** It's unethical and can damage trust if discovered.

**Instead, use:**
- **Service promise statements**: "We guarantee same-day response"
- **Platform badges with transparency**: Show Google Reviews badge even with zero reviews
- **Trust signals**: Industry certifications, licences, insurance details
- **Anonymised case studies**: Describe a real problem you solved without identifying the client
- **Your own voice**: Founder story, commitment, values

## 3. Design Approach Selection

### Single Featured Quote

**When to use:** One powerful, detailed testimonial. Homepage hero or landing page.

**Design principles:**
- Make it big, editorial, impactful
- Centre stage treatment
- Large, readable text
- Real photo if available, otherwise just the quote
- Don't diminish a great quote with a tiny card

### Grid of Quotes

**When to use:** 3-6 good testimonials. Dedicated testimonials section.

**Design principles:**
- Vary the formatting (one featured, rest standard)
- Don't make them all identical cards
- Mix with/without photos
- Different length quotes create visual rhythm
- Avoid perfect symmetry

### Integrated Quotes (Pull Quotes)

**When to use:** Long-form content (about pages, service descriptions). Quote directly supports nearby content.

**Design principles:**
- Pull the quote out of content flow
- Position near relevant content
- Feels most natural and least "marketing-y"

### Logo Wall + Quotes

**When to use:** B2B sites. Enterprise/professional services. Recognisable client brands.

**Design principles:**
- Client logos establish credibility
- One featured quote adds specificity
- Grey out logos for subtlety
- Only works if logos are recognisable

### NO CAROUSELS

**Never use testimonial carousels:**
- Carousels hide content — users see 1 out of 5 testimonials
- Users don't click carousel controls (<1% interaction)
- Auto-rotating prevents reading at own pace
- If you have 5 testimonials, show all 5 or curate the best 3

**If you must have motion:**
- Continuous scroll marquee (background texture, not primary content)
- User-controlled scroll (not auto-rotating)
- Pause on hover, respect prefers-reduced-motion

## 4. Content Principles

### Editing for Impact

**Keep it brief:** Brief quotes get read; paragraphs get skipped.

**Include the problem, not just praise:**
- "They fixed our emergency leak at midnight" > "Great service"
- Problem + solution = story

**Star ratings: only if real and verifiable:**
- Don't show stars unless from a real platform
- Link to the source
- All 5-star ratings look fake

**Photos of real people dramatically increase trust:**
- Real photos = huge credibility boost
- Stock photos = huge credibility loss
- No photo is better than fake photo

**Attribution standards:**
- Minimum: First name + last initial + location ("Sarah M., Maitland")
- Better: Full name + location + context ("Sarah Mitchell, Homeowner in Maitland")
- Best: Above + photo + date
- Never: "A satisfied customer" or "Happy client"

## 5. Placement

### Where Testimonials Work Best

**After presenting services:** You've explained what you do, now prove it works.

**Near CTA sections:** Reduce last-minute doubt. "Other people trusted us, you can too."

**Within service descriptions:** Pull quote format. "We offer 24/7 emergency service" -> testimonial about midnight call-out.

**Not necessarily in their own section:** Testimonials can be woven throughout. Context-relevant placement often works better.

---

## 6. Anti-Patterns

- **Carousel that auto-rotates** — Users can't read at their own pace
- **All testimonials saying the same thing** — Curate for variety: speed, quality, price, communication
- **Stock photo headshots** — Destroys all credibility
- **"John D." level anonymity** — Suggests you're hiding something
- **Three identical card-shaped testimonials** — Template-y, no visual hierarchy
- **All 5-star ratings** — Real reviews have variation; 4.7 is more believable than 5.0

---

## 7. When You Don't Have Testimonials

### Don't Fake Them

Fake testimonials are unethical, potentially illegal, easily discovered, and damage trust permanently.

### Use These Instead

- **Credentials and certifications**: Licensed, insured, industry memberships
- **Guarantees**: Money-back, warranty details, "If we're late, the visit is free"
- **Process descriptions**: Show how you work, what customers can expect
- **Link to review platform**: Even empty, shows transparency
- **Anonymised case studies**: "A homeowner in the Newcastle area contacted us with..."
- **Your own voice**: Founder story, why you started, your commitment
